Welcome to the Azure Landing Zones Accelerators for Bicep and Terraform!

The Azure landing zones [Terraform][alz_tf_module] and [Bicep][alz_bc_module] modules provide an opinionated approach for deploying and managing the core platform capabilities of [Azure landing zones architecture][alz_architecture] using Bicep or Terraform.

This accelerator provides an opinionated approach for configuring and securing those modules in a continuous delivery environment. It has end to end automation for bootstrapping the modules.

## Supported Version Control Systems (VCS)

The accelerator supports both Azure DevOps and GitHub. We are only able to support the hosted versions of these services.

If you are using self-hosted versions of these services or another VCS, you can still use the accelerator to produce the landing zone code by using the `alz_local` bootstrap module, but you will need to configure the VCS manually or with your own automation.

## Accelerator features

The accelerator bootstraps a continuous delivery environment for you. It supports both the Azure DevOps and GitHub version control system (VCS). It uses the [ALZ](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ALZ) PowerShell module to gather required user input and apply a Terraform module to configure the bootstrap environment.

> NOTE: For Bicep users, the accelerator uses Terraform to bootstrap the environment only. Bicep is used to deploy and update the Azure landing zone.

The accelerator follows a 3 phase approach:

1. Pre-requisites: Instructions to configure credentials and subscriptions.
2. Bootstrap: Run the PowerShell module to generate the continuous delivery environment.
3. Run: Update the module (if needed) to suit the needs of your organisation and deploy via continuous delivery.

The components of the environment are similar, but differ depending on your choice of VCS:
